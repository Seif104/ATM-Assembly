# ATM Program in Assembly Language

This is an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator implemented in assembly language. The project is designed to simulate the basic functionalities of a real ATM machine, including cash withdrawals, deposits, transfer cach, and balance inquiries.


## Features

- Withdraw cash: users can select the amount of cash they want to withdraw from their account balance.
- Deposit cash: users can deposit cash into their account by inserting cash into the ATM machine
- Transfer cach: users can transfer cach from their account to another account.
- Check account balance: users can check their account balance at any time.


## Getting Started

**To run this project, you will need an assembler and simulator.**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the ATM.asm file in your assembler and assemble the code.
3. Run the assembled code in your simulator.
## Usage

Once the code is running in your simulator, you can interact with the ATM machine by following the prompts on the screen. Use the keypad to enter your choices and follow the instructions to complete your transactions.
